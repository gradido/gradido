# Build Login-Server yourself 
## Linux (Ubuntu) Packets
install build essentials 

```bash
sudo apt install -y gcovr build-essential gettext libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libsodium-dev libboost-dev
``` 

## CMake
CMake is used for build file generation and the Login-Server needs at least version v3.18.2
You can build and install it from source. 
The Version in apt is sadly to old.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kitware/CMake.git --branch v3.18.2
cd CMake
./bootstrap --parallel=$(nproc) && make -j$(nproc) && sudo make install
```

## dependencies 
load git submodules if you haven't done it yet

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## build tools
build protoc and page compiler needed for generating some additional code

```bash
cd scripts
./prepare_build.sh 
```

## build 
build login-server in debug mode

```bash
cd scripts
./build_debug.sh
```

## multilanguage text 
Login-Server uses gettext translations found after build in src/LOCALE
On Linux Login-Server expect the *.po files in folder /etc/grd_login/LOCALE
on windows next to Binary in Folder LOCALE.
So please copy them over by yourself on first run or after change.

If you like to update some translations your find a messages.pot in src/LOCALE.
Use it together with poedit and don't forget to copy over *.po files after change to /etc/grd_login/LOCALE
To update messages.pot run 

```bash
./scripts/compile_pot.sh 
```
This will be also called by ./scripts/build_debug.sh

## database
Login-Server needs a db to run, it is tested with mariadb.
Currently at least one group must be present in table groups.
For example:
```sql
INSERT INTO `groups` (`id`, `alias`, `name`, `url`, `host`, `home`, `description`) VALUES
(1, 'docker', 'docker gradido group', 'localhost', 'localhost', '/', 'gradido test group for docker with blockchain db');
```

## configuration
Login-Server needs a configuration file to able to run. 
On Linux it expect it to find the file /etc/grd_login/grd_login.properties
and /etc/grd_login/grd_login_test.properties for unittest

Example configuration (ini-format)
```ini
# Port for Web-Interface
HTTPServer.port = 1200
# Port for json-Interface (used by new backend)
JSONServer.port = 1201
# default group id for new users, if no group was choosen
Gradido.group_id = 1
