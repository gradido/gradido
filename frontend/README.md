## install grass, a faster sass compiler written in rust
First install [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) if not already installed.

Then install grass, it need some time, because it will be compiled.
```bash
cargo install grass
```	
Now with using yarn compile-sass or turbo compile-sass grass will be used.
