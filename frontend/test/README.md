# Jest Unit And Integration Tests

## Mocking The Apollo Client

To mock the Apollo client in integration tests we use the package `mock-apollo-client`.
You'll find the GitHub repository with a description
[here](https://github.com/Mike-Gibson/mock-apollo-client).

A good additionally description how that works we can find on:
[Testing Vue+Apollo: 2020 edition](https://dev.to/n_tepluhina/testing-vue-apollo-2020-edition-2l2p)
